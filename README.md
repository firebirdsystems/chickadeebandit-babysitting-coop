# Babysitting Co-op Ledger

A points ledger for a babysitting-exchange co-op. Adults log the hours they sat
for another household, the other parent confirms, and the app tracks who owes
whom. Members can also post coverage requests that other co-op members claim.

## How it works

- **Hours ledger** — when you sit for another member you log the sitting (you're
  the sitter, so you earn the credit). The entry is a `party_scoped` row visible
  only to the two of you. Credit is counted **only after both parties confirm**,
  which is tracked in a separate `endpoint_only` agreement table written solely by
  the hub's `api/agree` endpoint (the `agreements` mechanism). Because balances are
  derived from that agreement table — never from a value the parties can set on the
  ledger row — nobody can mint credit for themselves: the counterparty simply never
  confirms a bogus entry. Every member sees only their own running balance and the
  entries they are party to.
- **Coverage board** — post a request for a sitter; other members claim it through
  the `slot_claims` hub endpoints, which enforce the "one sitter, no double-booking"
  capacity guard atomically. The claims table is `endpoint_only`, so a member can't
  bypass capacity with raw SQL.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Preview locally
npm run dev   # opens http://localhost:3001

# 2. Build the installable bundle
npm run build  # produces dist/bundle.json

# 3. Install in your hub
#    Paste the dist/bundle.json URL into Hub → Apps → Install from URL
```

## manifest.json reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Yes | Unique slug, e.g. `chore-tracker`. Must be unique in the hub. |
| `name` | Yes | Display name shown in the hub |
| `version` | Yes | Semver string |
| `description` | Yes | One-line description |
| `entrypoint` | Yes | Entry file, almost always `index.html` |
| `runtime` | Yes | `static` for HTML/JS apps (use this) |
| `icon` | No | App icon — emoji (e.g. `"🛒"`) or a filename bundled with the app (e.g. `"icon.svg"`, `"icon.png"`). Shown in the marketplace, installed apps list, and nav bar. |
| `storage` | Yes | `"kv"` (key/value blob), `"db"` (SQL), or `"none"` (no app-owned storage — uses hub-native data only) |
| `data_access.reads` | Yes | Family data keys this app reads (see below) |
| `data_access.writes` | Yes | Family data keys this app writes |
| `permissions.default_audience` | Yes | `everyone`, `adults`, or `children` |
| `permissions.requires_approval` | Yes | If true, hub admin must approve before app goes active |
| `resource_limits` | Yes | Storage caps — even if using defaults, declare this to signal the limits were considered (see below) |
| `category` | No | e.g. `health`, `finance`, `games`, `tools` |
| `tags` | No | Array of strings for filtering |
| `nav` | No | `{ "label": "..." }` — adds the app to the hub's top navigation bar. Uses `icon` automatically. Omit for infrequently-accessed apps. |
| `widget` | No | `{ "label": "...", "size": "small" \| "medium" \| "large" }` — shows an iframe summary tile on the dashboard (needs a `widget.html`) |
| `glance` | No | `"storage": "db"` apps only — a lightweight, hub-rendered dashboard tile (one SQL query + a display template, no iframe, no extra HTML). See "Glance widgets" below. |
| `row_policies` | No | `"storage": "db"` apps only — hub-enforced per-table row access rules (private data, board/committee-only tables, etc.). See "Row-level access control" in CLAUDE.md. |

### resource_limits

Declare `resource_limits` even when accepting defaults, so limits are explicit:

```json
"resource_limits": {
  "max_store_bytes": 524288,         // kv apps: max KV storage (default 5 MB)
  "max_store_reads_per_day": 500,    // kv apps: read requests per day (default 1000)
  "max_store_writes_per_day": 200,   // kv apps: write requests per day (default 500)
  "max_db_bytes": 52428800,          // db apps: SQLite/Postgres size cap (default 200 MB)
  "max_file_bytes": 10485760,        // file-uploading apps: max size per file (default 10 MB)
  "max_files_bytes": 524288000       // file-uploading apps: total file storage (default 500 MB)
}
```

Apps with `"storage": "none"` do not need `resource_limits`.

### Glance widgets

A **glance** is a lightweight dashboard tile the hub renders itself from one read-only SQL query — no iframe, no `widget.html`, no app code. Prefer it over `widget` for a simple "one number / short list / alert count" summary; reach for `widget` only when the tile needs real interactivity. `"storage": "db"` apps only.

```jsonc
"glance": {
  "source": {
    "kind": "sql",
    // A single SELECT over your OWN prefixed tables, with a small LIMIT.
    // Runs through the same path as /api/db — your row_policies and column
    // decryption apply, and the query is shown in the admin approval diff.
    "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) AS n FROM app_myapp__items WHERE checked = 0 LIMIT 1"
  },
  "display": { "template": "badge", "count": "n", "label": "to buy", "severity": "info" }
}
```

Three display templates — every column a template names must appear in the query's `SELECT` list (alias with `AS` as needed):

| Template | Reads | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `stat` | row 0 | `value` (column), `label` (static text), optional `empty_hides` (hide the tile when the value is 0/empty) |
| `list` | up to 5 rows | `title` (column), optional `subtitle` (column), optional `when` (column holding an ISO date/time, shown as a relative "in 3d") |
| `badge` | row 0 | `count` (column), `label` (static text), optional `severity` (`info` \| `warn` \| `alert`) — a count of 0 hides the tile |

Query rules (enforced by `node build.mjs` manifest validation): exactly one `SELECT`; only your own `app_{appId}__` tables; a `LIMIT` between 1 and 10; explicit named columns (no `SELECT *`). Tapping the tile opens your app. A glance whose query fails is silently dropped, so it never breaks the dashboard. Reference apps: `grocery` (badge), `chores` (stat), `calendar` (list).

### Available data_access keys

```
family.members
family.calendar
family.preferences
family.health.medications
family.health.conditions
family.finances.budget
family.finances.transactions
family.finances.allowances
family.finances.rewards
family.documents
```

## Reading family data from your app

The hub injects `window.__FAMILY_HUB_CONTEXT_URL` into your app's page. Use it as the base URL for hub API calls:

```js
const BASE = window.__FAMILY_HUB_CONTEXT_URL ?? "";

const res = await fetch(`${BASE}/api/family`);
const members = await res.json();
```

The hub enforces `data_access` — requests for data not declared in your manifest will be rejected.

## Publishing via GitHub releases (optional)

Push to `main` — the included GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
1. Runs `node build.mjs`
2. Creates a release tagged `v{version}` from `manifest.json`
3. Uploads `dist/bundle.json` as the release asset

Anyone can then install your app by pasting the release asset URL into their hub:
```
https://github.com/firebirdsystems/chickadeebandit-your-app/releases/latest/download/bundle.json
```

## Creating apps without GitHub

If you're using Claude or another AI connected to your hub via MCP, you can skip the template entirely. Just describe the app you want — the AI will generate and deploy it directly using the `publish_app` MCP tool. No build step, no repo, no release needed.
